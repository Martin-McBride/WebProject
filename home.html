					<h4>Apostrophe Rant</h4>
					<p>
						I really don't like apostrophes, but I feel like the writing here sounds a bit
						awkward, so I've decided to just give in and start using them anyway. As for
						why I hate apostrophes, I really don't know, it all started when I was just
						a boy. I was new and I was green and I didn't know any better.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyway, enjoy the website. I worked on it to some degree of difficulty, though
						it didn't take very long cuz it's a pretty simple website. It's just some basic
						html and css magic thrown in. Luckily this isn't graded on content or appearance
						and more just on functionality and structure.

					My name is Martin McBride. I am a computer science major at Siena College.
					I am here to tell you about some things. What are those things? I do not know
					yet, but I am sure we will find out soon. I guess we will start with why I made
					this website, which is a good question with a pretty simple answer. This is basically
					just to show off some HTML and CSS stuff, and not much else.
				<p>
					If you read the aside before reading this for some reason, you'll have heard my
					whole apostrophe speech already. But the truth is, I wrote this paragraph after
					I wrote the aside. Bet you didn't that would happen. Anyway, more about myself I
					guess. Video games are pretty cool, I like to play a wide variety of them, from
					Wolfenstein to Pokemon, from Final Fantasy to Mass Effect, from The Legend of Zelda
					to the Elder Scrolls and Fallout. After playing games I like to pit them against each
					other to figure out which one I think is better, and hopefully one day I'll have some
					party in either the programming or design aspect of games. Or maybe I'll be an indie
					developer and have to work on a bit of everything, which could be cool too. But, you
					you know, if all else fails there is a lot of stuff you can do with a computer science
					degree, so if I can't get into game development I can do other things.
